# Kubernetes BuildCop Workflow

June 2017

Authors: foxish@, dawnchen@

**SHARED PUBLICLY**

## Objective

This document describes the responsibilities and the workflow of a person assuming the buildcop role. 
The current buildcop can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-jenkins/oncall.html).

## Prerequisites for build-copping

- Ensure you have write access to [http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes](http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
  - Test your admin access by e.g. adding a label to an issue.
- You must communicate any concerns/actions via the **#sig-release** slack channel to ensure that the release team 
has context on the current state of the submit queue.
- You must attend the release burndown meeting to provide an update on the current state of the submit-queue

## Responsibilities

The build-cop's primary responsibility is to ensure that automatic merges are happening at a **reasonable** rate.
This may include performing merging of test flake PRs when the pre-submits are failing repeatedly. The buildcop must be familiar 
with the [queue labels](https://submit-queue.k8s.io/#/info) and apply them as necessary to critical fixes. The priority 
labels are defunct and no longer respected by the submit-queue. As of June 2017, the merge rate is ~30 PRs per day 
if there are that many PRs in the queue. The previous responsibilities of this role included classification of incoming issues, 
but that is no longer a part of the mandate.

## Workflow

1. Check the Prow batch dashboard: [https://prow.k8s.io/?type=batch](https://prow.k8s.io/?type=batch) to ensure that merges are occurring regularly.
2. If there are post-submit blocking jobs (see [link](https://submit-queue.k8s.io/#/e2e)), ensure that those builds are green and allowing merges to occur.
3. If several batch merges are failing, file an issue for that job and describe the possible causes for the failure. 
Debug if possible, else triage and assign to a particular SIG, and @-mention the maintainers. 
For example, see: [https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47135](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47135)
4. Communicate the actions to # **sig-release** via slack and ensure that the issue is being worked on.
  1. If the issue is not worked on for several hours, please escalate to the release team.
5. When the SIG member sends a fix, manually merge if necessary, after verifying that pre-submits pass, 
or use the 'retest-not-required' label with the appropriate 'queue/*' label to ensure merge of the flake fix.
6. Issue an update to the # **sig-release** channel on the merge rate and the PR that was used to fix it.
